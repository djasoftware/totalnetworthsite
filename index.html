        <h2>Privacy Policy</h2>
        <p class="sub">Effective date: February 2026 · Last updated: February 2026</p>

        <p>Total Networth ("the App") is developed and operated by Deo Jose Anthonio Balasbas. This privacy policy explains how the App handles your information.</p>

        <h3>Data Collection</h3>
        <p><strong>We do not collect any data.</strong> The App operates entirely offline. No personal information is collected, stored on any server, or shared with anyone.</p>
        <ul>
            <li>No personal data collected</li>
            <li>No usage analytics or tracking</li>
            <li>No third-party SDKs, services, or advertising</li>
            <li>No cookies or web tracking</li>
            <li>No network connections of any kind</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Data Storage</h3>
        <p>All data you enter (assets, liabilities, goals, settings, and PIN) is stored locally on your device using Apple's SwiftData framework. This data exists only on your device and is not accessible to us or any third party.</p>

        <h3>PIN Security</h3>
        <p>If you enable the optional PIN lock, your PIN is never stored as plain text. It is hashed using SHA256 with a unique cryptographic salt before being saved to your device.</p>

        <h3>Your Rights</h3>
        <p>Since all data is stored locally on your device, you have full control over it at all times. You can view, modify, or delete any data within the App. To delete all data completely, uninstall the App from your device.</p>

        <h3>Children's Privacy</h3>
        <p>The App does not collect personal information from anyone, including children under the age of 13. The App complies with the Children's Online Privacy Protection Act (COPPA).</p>

        <h3>Changes to This Policy</h3>
        <p>If we make changes to this privacy policy, the updated version will be posted on this page with a new "Last updated" date. We encourage you to review this page periodically.</p>
